## An online educational platform where teachers can create courses, and students can learn at their own pace.

## Problem Statement

The conventional MOOC format and Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) based study tools complement each other in a way that suggests a deeper integration of the two systems could create a more complete educational experience than is commonly found with either alone. This project seeks to synthesize both into a single tool that addresses their respective drawbacks with the others' features.
